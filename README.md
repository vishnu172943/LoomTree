LoomTree: A Warp-Weft Chrono-Spatial Index
LoomTree is a novel, high-performance data structure invented to solve a fundamental paradox in data indexing: the need for simultaneous efficiency in both spatial and temporal queries. It provides a robust, zero-dependency solution for analyzing large-scale, timestamped geospatial event data.

## The Problem: The Tyranny of "OR"
Modern data systems frequently capture events that have both a location and a time. Analyzing this data requires asking two distinct types of questions:

Spatial: "What happened in this specific area?"

Temporal: "What happened during this specific time window?"

Traditional data structures force a compromise. You must choose:

A Spatial Index (like a Quadtree or R-tree) is brilliant for location-based queries but must perform a slow, full scan of all data points to answer a time-based question.

A Temporal Index (like a B-Tree on a timestamp) is excellent for time-range queries but must perform a full scan to find points within a geographic area.

Systems were forced to choose one, build and maintain two separate, complex indexes, or accept poor performance on one axis.

## The Invention: Introducing LoomTree üß¨
LoomTree eliminates this compromise. It is a hybrid data structure that "weaves" together two orthogonal indexing spines over a single, shared set of event records, much like the warp and weft threads of a loom.

The Warp (Spatial Spine): An adaptive Quadtree partitions the 2D space, providing rapid access to data based on location.

The Weft (Temporal Spine): A randomized Treap (a self-balancing binary search tree) orders the same data by timestamp, providing rapid access based on time.

By cross-linking these two spines at the event level, LoomTree creates a unified structure that excels at both query types without duplicating data or sacrificing performance.

## Specialities & Key Features
‚ö° Dual-Axis Efficiency: Provides expected O(log n + k) time complexity for both pure spatial and pure temporal queries, where n is the total number of events and k is the number of results.

üíæ Memory Efficiency: Events are stored only once. The two indexing spines consist of lightweight pointers and nodes, avoiding the massive overhead of data duplication.

üåê Zero Dependencies: The entire data structure and its accompanying testbench are implemented in pure, vanilla JavaScript, demonstrating the concept's portability and fundamental nature.

üî¨ Proven & Justified: The invention is supported by a full technical whitepaper (embedded in the proof-of-concept file) detailing its architecture, algorithms, and complexity analysis.

## Use Cases
The LoomTree is designed for any application that requires high-performance, interactive analysis of large-scale spatio-temporal data.

üó∫Ô∏è GIS & Environmental Science: Instantly query decades of climate data for lightning strikes, earthquakes, or sensor readings within either a specific region or a specific time window.

üöö Logistics & Fleet Management: Analyze vehicle movements for an entire national fleet, seamlessly switching between replaying traffic in a single neighborhood and viewing a snapshot of all vehicles at a specific moment in time.

üèôÔ∏è IoT & Smart Cities: Power interactive dashboards for urban planners, allowing them to query years of sensor data to analyze traffic, pollution, or utility usage by location or time with equal ease.

üåê Network Security & Epidemiology: Track and visualize the spread of global events like cyberattacks or disease outbreaks, identifying geographic hotspots and temporal waves without needing to build separate, specialized views.

## Performance
Operation	Average Time Complexity	Justification

query_spatial(rect)	O(log n + k)	Traverses relevant Quadtree branches and scans k results.
query_temporal(range)	O(log n + k)	Traverses relevant Treap branches and scans k results.

## Importance of the Invention
The LoomTree is more than just a data structure; it represents a new paradigm for flexible, high-performance analysis of event data. By refusing to compromise between space and time, it unlocks the ability to build more powerful, intuitive, and insightful analytical tools. It removes a long-standing technical barrier, allowing developers and scientists to ask questions of their data in the way they think, not in the way their database is structured.
